# Creation handoff

The current state of the creation-side work: schematic, PCB and library tools. Anyone picking this up, human or agent, starts here. Update this file in the same commit that changes the state. The simulation track has its own file, [`SIMULATION_HANDOFF.md`](SIMULATION_HANDOFF.md).

**Last updated:** 2026-11-06. The research is done. PR 1 (#19) and PR 2 (#20) are merged. PR 3 is open and not merged. PR 4 is next and not started; ask the owner before starting it.

## Start here

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for the rules.
2. Create a branch from `main` for the work, unless "Now" names an open one to continue.
3. Read the PR row below, then the sections of `docs/CREATION_RESEARCH.md` it names (§3 has the evidence, §4 the sequence, §5 the owner's decisions).
4. Run the gate before changing anything, so you know the baseline. It is under "Verify" in `docs/SIMULATION_HANDOFF.md`.
5. If a step cannot run in your environment, such as `gh`, a push or `kicad-cli`, say so. Never skip it silently.

## The goal

Make Konnect's creation tools do what its agents are already told to do. The build and review agents are told to check that connectivity matches intent, and until PR 1 no tool could. The research ([`CREATION_RESEARCH.md`](CREATION_RESEARCH.md), from [`CREATION_RESEARCH_PROMPT.md`](CREATION_RESEARCH_PROMPT.md)) ranks 46 changes and orders the first 15 into PRs. Counts in it are from before PR 1; the registry is the source for current ones.

Owner decisions (2026-11-06, research §5):

| ID | Decision |
|---|---|
| Q1 | Konnect-owned placement and routing planners are allowed as a second opinion, never as the author. A planner returns a read-only plan; the AI compares it with its own result and adopts what is good through the normal editing tools. Planners start only after PRs 1, 7 and 8 provide the metrics |
| Q2 | Freerouting is the route path, after the core PRs (1 to 15). Widen the DSN profile (rank 32) first. Until then PR 5 documents it with its limits |
| Q3 | One design-intent record per project (rails, currents, interfaces, fab target). Ranks 12, 29 and 38 read from it. It gets its own PR before PR 11; PR 11 may take a per-call currents argument as an interim |
| Q4 | KiCad 10 variants and jobsets stay parked (`ROADMAP.md`) |
| Scope | macOS first. Windows and Linux are validated at the end of the series |

## Now: PR 3, response budget

The client refuses a tool result near 50,000 characters. Real use had 8 ERC/DRC results refused at 51 to 71 thousand, which sent the assistant to run `kicad-cli` itself. One helper, `tools/response_budget.rs`, now does the cutting:

- `window(args, default)` reads `limit` (1 to 10,000) and `offset`; a present value it cannot read is refused, not replaced by the default.
- `page(items, offset, limit, budget)` stops at `limit` or at 40,000 characters of items, whichever comes first, and always returns one item when any remain. `describe` adds `shown`, `offset`, `limit`, `truncated` and, when truncated, `next_offset`, `byte_capped` and a `hint`. `tally` counts every item by rule and severity, not just the page. `list_response` is the same for plain lists.
- Applied to `run_erc` (new `limit` default 100, `offset`, `by_rule`), `run_drc` and `get_drc_violations` (shared `drc::violations_page`; the latter had no limit at all), `list_schematic_components`, `list_symbol_libraries` and `list_footprint_libraries`. `output` still writes the full, unpaged report, which is the "full report on disk" part.
- `load_toolset` returns each tool's first sentence (110 characters at most) by default; `detail: "full"` returns the old text. `tools/list` is unchanged. This was 20% of the bytes returned in real use.

Not done, and still open under rank 3: C24 (a `zone_fill_state` field on DRC, which depends on this), and A30's other long results (`batch_place_components`, `update_pcb_from_schematic`, `validate_for_manufacturing`, the batch wiring tools), `get_component_list` and `query_traces`. They can reuse the helper. A caller that read every violation in one `get_drc_violations` or `run_erc` call must now follow `next_offset` or pass `output`; `docs/API_MIGRATIONS.md` says so.

Proof: `response_budget_tests.rs` runs the real ERC handler against a stand-in `kicad-cli` that serves a 700-violation report (under the cap, counts of all 700, pages cover each violation once, `output` holds all of them), the DRC pager on 900 violations, and the list tools. Six guards were broken one at a time (the byte cap, the whole-list tally, truncation, paging order of `output`, argument checking, the summary) and each failed a test. Limits left: the cap counts characters of listed items only, so a response with very large non-list fields could still be large; the stand-in is not KiCad's own large report; the live KiCad was not asked.

## PR 2, route safety (merged, #20)

Two commits:

- **#901 ported as it stands** (author Paulius Zaleckas, cherry-picked with `-x`): `connect_pins`, `batch_connect_pins` and `add_schematic_connection` try the other L-bend and refuse with `plan_blocked` when both would join another net. One conflict, in `docs/API_MIGRATIONS.md`, kept both entries.
- **#899 and #900, which #901 touches the same path as.** A stub from `connect_to_net` or `batch_connect_to_net` is checked the same way (`pick_stub_direction`): `auto` tries the other directions, a named direction that would join is refused or, in the batch, skipped into `errors`. Reaching what already carries the stub's own net name is not a join, because the label joins it anyway (an existing test needs this). `add_wire`, `batch_add_wire` and the stub wires dot only the T's the new wire forms (`t_junctions_on`). `add_wire` takes coordinates, so it draws what it is given and only reports.
- **`nets_joined`** (`sch_wiring::nets_joined`) on all seven wiring tools: `[{nets: [...]}]` for each net that now holds two or more nets the sheet had before; `[]` for none; `null` when pins cannot be resolved. A net of bare wires is not listed.

Proof: `route_safety_tests.rs`. The fast tests read the file. One ignored test asks the real KiCad, through `compare_netlist`, that the result connects what was meant on the #901 fixture (a far wire changes nothing, a refused route changes nothing, the avoided pin stays alone, the stub leaves the tee alone):

```bash
cargo test -p konnect-core --lib route_safety -- --ignored
```

Guards were broken one at a time (the join check, the T filter, the stub check, the report); each failed fast tests and the live one. Limits left: the check sees pins, labels and sheet pins, so two bare-wire nets with nothing on them can still touch unreported; labels or power symbols that merge nets by name are out of its sight until `compare_netlist` runs; `add_power_symbol`, `add_junction`, the bus tools and the `move_*` tools were not looked at, and `add_wire` / `batch_add_wire` only report.

## PR 1, the netlist read and compare (merged, #19)

Two tools in the `sch_export` toolset (`tools/sch_netlist.rs`, tests in `tools/sch_netlist_tests.rs`).

- **`get_schematic_netlist(schematic, limit, offset, name_contains)`** returns `{net: ["REF.PIN", ...]}` for the whole hierarchy. `schematic` is the root sheet or the `.kicad_pro`; a sub-sheet is refused with the root named, because KiCad would export it as if it were the design. The saved sheets are copied into a private folder (the simulation snapshot, `simulation/snapshot.rs`) and `kicad-cli sch export netlist --format kicadsexpr` runs on the copy (`cli::export_kicad_netlist_text`), then `simulation::kicad_netlist::parse` reads it. That parser keeps every node, which `pcb_sync::parse_exported_netlist` does not (it drops footprint-less parts and bails on a pad in two nets), so the schematic check uses the simulation one. Nets KiCad names itself (`Net-(R1-Pad2)`, `unconnected-(R2-Pad2)`) are included. Pages stop at 40,000 characters of net data or `limit` nets, whichever comes first, and say `truncated` and `next_offset`. One net is cut to 300 pins with its true size in `pins_truncated`.
- **`compare_netlist(schematic, intended | reference_schematic | reference_netlist, scope, limit)`** compares pin sets, never net names. `missing` is an intended pin the design does not have. `split` is one intended net spread over several design nets. `merged` is one design net holding pins of several intended nets. `extra` is a pin joined to a net the intent does not give it. The verdict is `pass`, `fail`, or `incomplete`. With `intended`, `scope: listed_pins` (default) looks only at the pins listed, so a partial intent works; `complete` also reports every other pin joined to them. A second design or a `.net` file is always compared completely.
- **`incomplete` is deliberate.** A duplicated reference (two `R1`) puts one pin id on two nets, so it cannot be told apart. Nothing wrong found plus that ambiguity reads `incomplete`, never `pass`. Unannotated references (`R?`) are warned about.
- **Saved files only.** The result never includes unsaved editor changes, and says so (`source.saved_files_only`, plus `editor_locks` and a warning when KiCad holds a lock). Callers save first.
- **Do not build on** the per-file `NetGraph` or design_review's per-sheet scope: neither merges nets across sheets.

Evidence: the committed `tests/fixtures/single_pin_nets.net` is KiCad's own export of a two-sheet hierarchy (README beside it). Unit tests run in the normal gate, including the handlers against a stand-in `kicad-cli`. One ignored test runs the real KiCad on edited copies and covers a hierarchical net, an unnamed net, a split and a merged case:

```bash
cargo test -p konnect-core --lib sch_netlist -- --ignored
```

Seven guards were broken one at a time and each broke a test (split, merged and extra detection, the size cap, the incomplete verdict, the missing-pin check, and the snapshot copy). The tools were also run through the built binary over stdio (`load_toolset` then both tools, a refusal included) on a scratch copy of the fixture. Limits left: the sub-sheet refusal needs a `.kicad_pro` beside the sheets, as `run_erc`'s does; a loose child sheet with no project file is read as its own root, and the response's `design_components` and `source.schematic` show what was read. It reads a design KiCad can export, so a project that does not load has no answer; pin ids are `REF.PIN` with the first dot as the separator; there is no `outcome` envelope yet (this track's rank 41); Windows and Linux were not run.

PR 2 should call `compare_netlist` with `reference_schematic` on a copy of the project taken before the wiring change. Edits to `connect_pins` and its siblings are in `tools/sch_wiring.rs`.
